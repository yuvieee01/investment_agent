# InvestAgent — AI-Powered Investment Research Agent

> **Live Demo:** [investment-agent-one.vercel.app](https://investment-agent-one.vercel.app/)

An autonomous multi-agent system that researches any public company in real time and delivers a structured **INVEST / PASS / MONITOR** verdict with confidence scoring, bullish/bearish factor analysis, and full reasoning — powered by a LangGraph agent pipeline, Tavily web search, and Google Gemini LLMs.

---

## Overview

InvestAgent takes a company name (e.g. "Tesla") and orchestrates a multi-step research pipeline:

1. **Resolves** the company → ticker, full legal name, sector.
2. **Researches in parallel** — financials, news, competitors, and industry trends — using live web search (Tavily) and LLM analysis.
3. **Synthesizes** all research into a unified analysis.
4. **Makes a final investment decision** — INVEST, PASS, or MONITOR — with a 0-100 confidence score, full reasoning, and 5 bullish/bearish factors.

The entire pipeline streams results to the frontend in real time via Server-Sent Events (SSE), so you can watch each step complete as it happens.

## How It Works

### Architecture

The core of the system is a **LangGraph StateGraph** — a directed acyclic graph where each node is a specialist agent that reads from and writes to a shared state object.

```

|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Framework   | Next.js 16 (App Router)                                |
| Agent Graph | LangGraph.js (`@langchain/langgraph`)                  |
| LLM         | Google Gemini (multi-model cascade)                    |
| Web Search  | Tavily Search API (`@langchain/tavily`)                |
| Streaming   | Server-Sent Events (SSE) via `ReadableStream`          |
| Frontend    | React 19, vanilla CSS (premium dark theme)             |
| Deployment  | Vercel (serverless functions)                          |

### Data Flow

1. **Frontend** → `POST /api/research` with `{ company }`.
2. **API Route** → Runs `investmentGraph.streamEvents()` and pushes SSE events (`node_complete`, `result`, `error`, `done`).
3. **Frontend** → Parses the SSE stream, updates a live timeline, and renders the final Decision Card.

### Shared State

All nodes read/write to a single `AgentState` object using LangGraph's `Annotation` system:

- **Input:** `company`
- **Resolved:** `ticker`, `fullName`, `sector`
- **Research:** `financialData`, `newsData`, `competitorData`, `industryData`
- **Analysis:** `analysis` (synthesized markdown)
- **Decision:** `decision`, `confidence`, `reasoning`, `bullishFactors`, `bearishFactors`

Channels like `completedSteps` use array-append reducers so parallel nodes can write to the same channel without conflicts.

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Multi-Model Cascade Instead of Exponential Backoff

**Problem:** Gemini's free tier has strict rate limits (5 requests/min, 20 requests/day per model). Our pipeline makes 7 LLM calls per analysis (1 resolve + 4 parallel research + 1 synthesis + 1 decision), so hitting rate limits was inevitable.

**What I tried first:** Exponential backoff with retry (10s → 20s → 40s → 80s). This worked in theory, but in practice the wait times compounded to 3-5 minutes of dead time, and daily quotas meant retries would just keep failing.

![Exponential backoff hitting rate limits repeatedly](docs/screenshots/rate_limit_backoff.png)

**What I did instead:** A **model cascade** — the LLM wrapper pre-initializes 4 different Gemini models and tries them in sequence. If one hits a rate limit, it instantly switches to the next model with zero wait time:

```
gemini-3.1-flash-lite → gemini-3-flash-preview → gemini-3.5-flash → gemini-3.1-pro-preview
```

This is faster and more resilient: each model has its own independent rate-limit quota, so even when one is exhausted the next one can serve requests immediately.

### 2. Parallel Research Nodes

The four research steps (financials, news, competitors, industry) are **independent of each other** — they only depend on the resolved company info. LangGraph lets us fan out from `resolveCompany` to all four, and they execute in parallel. This cuts the total research time by ~4x compared to sequential execution.

**Trade-off:** Parallel nodes writing to the same state channel (`currentStep`) caused `INVALID_CONCURRENT_GRAPH_UPDATE` errors. I fixed this by adding a custom reducer that accepts the last value.

### 3. SSE Streaming Over WebSockets

For real-time updates I chose Server-Sent Events over WebSockets because:
- One-way data flow (server → client) is all we need
- Native browser support with `EventSource` / `fetch` streaming
- Works on Vercel's serverless infrastructure (no persistent connections needed)
- Simpler to implement and debug

### 4. Tavily Over Custom Scraping

Tavily provides clean, structured search results optimized for LLMs. Building a custom web scraper would add complexity (rate limiting, parsing, anti-bot protections) without meaningfully improving quality for this use case.

### 5. What I Left Out

- **Historical price data / charts** — Would need a financial data API (e.g. Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) which was out of scope.
- **User portfolio tracking** — Requires authentication, database, and recurring analysis.
- **Multi-company comparison** — The agent analyzes one company at a time; batch mode would be a natural extension.
- **Source citations** — The research nodes consume Tavily results but don't surface individual source URLs in the final output.

## What I Would Improve With More Time

1. **Source Citations & Transparency** — Surface the individual URLs and snippets from Tavily so users can verify claims and drill into primary sources.

2. **Financial Data APIs** — Integrate Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance for real financial metrics (P/E, revenue, margins, price history) instead of relying on web search for numbers.

3. **Interactive Charts** — Add stock price charts, revenue trend visualizations, and competitive comparison spider diagrams.

4. **Caching Layer** — Cache research results (e.g. Redis or in-memory) with TTL so repeated queries for the same company don't re-run the full pipeline.

5. **Multi-Company Comparison** — Let users analyze and compare multiple companies side-by-side in a single session.

6. **Streaming Token-by-Token** — Currently the UI waits for each graph node to fully complete. Streaming the LLM output token-by-token within each node would make the experience feel more responsive.

7. **Agent Memory & Context** — Let the agent remember past analyses so it can say "compared to when we analyzed this company last week, the outlook has improved because..."

8. **Better Error Recovery** — If one research node fails (e.g. Tavily timeout), the pipeline should degrade gracefully and still produce a partial analysis rather than failing entirely.
